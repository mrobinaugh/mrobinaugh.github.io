        <p>The UAM project was conducted with joint support from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Honeywell Aerospace and was led by Dr. Johann Dorfling. The goal of the project was to characterize flight performance of an electric air taxi. My role on the team was the flight team lead, and I oversaw our test flights and ensured we were following all of our set procedures to ensure safe flights. The UAM project has experienced its fair share of issues over the past year. This included numerous failed test flights, components catching on fire, and a malfunctioning telemetry system. Even though each of these things were big setbacks, it has taught me very important lessons in trouble shooting, communication between teams, and proper documentation to ensure finding issues is as easy as possible.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2023/03/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" srcset="../content/images/2023/03/image.png 600w"></figure>
