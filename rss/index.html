The goal of the project was to develop a platform and the control law to enable simulated one-dimensional attitude control of a physical model. I was the sole researcher on the team and was in charge of developing the control law as well as designing and testing the platform. This project helped teach me how to apply the theory we learned in class to a real-world system with all of its imperfections.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/03/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="604" height="455" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-2.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/03/image-2.png 604w"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[HONEYWELL/EMBRY-RIDDLE JOINT UAM RESEARCH PROJECT]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The UAM project was conducted with joint support from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Honeywell Aerospace and was led by Dr. Johann Dorfling.

The goal of the project was to characterize flight performance of an electric air taxi. My role on the team was the flight team lead, and I oversaw our test flights and ensured we were following all of our set procedures to ensure safe flights. The UAM project has experienced its fair share of issues over the past year. This included numerous failed test flights, components catching on fire, and a malfunctioning telemetry system. Even though each of these things were big setbacks, it has taught me very important lessons in trouble shooting, communication between teams, and proper documentation to ensure finding issues is as easy as possible.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/03/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/03/image.png 600w"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[PROPULSIVE LANDING SENIOR DESIGN PROJECT]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>For my senior capstone design project, a team of six engineering students and I are working to develop a model capable of demonstrating a propulsive rocket landing using a solid rocket motor.

For the last semester, I have been working on developing the main structure of the system as well as collaborating on the production of the control software we are using for the lander. We primarily used CATIA to design our model and a combination of Simulink and C++ to generate our control software. The design of our model has changed drastically from the original design. Our original project was to create a full 3-Dimensional lander but moving into our second semester, we realized that due to time and budget constraints we would only be able to produce a test stand version of the project. To design the structure of the system we used the estimated weight and load the system will be under during tests to calculate thicknesses of brackets needed to minimize deflection. We are currently in the stage of building and testing our design to ensure it meets our requirements. Over the course of the project, I have learned a lot more about budgeting skills, teamwork, technical document creation, and the engineering work that goes into building a real system. The image below shows our current design for the test stand and the structure for the vehicle model.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/03/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="455" height="450"></figure>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
